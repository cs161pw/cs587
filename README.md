# PROJECT - Part 1

Part 1 work:

1. create 3 tables in PostGreSQL (using script in repo)
2. write code to generate data (data file in repo)
3. import data file into PostGreSQL (pgAdmin 4)
4. run SELECT * query to demonstrate that tables contain data

System being used: PostGreSQL with pgAdmin 4
   Reason for choice: I used PostGreSQL a little bit in CS 586, but want to develop more skill in using it as a tool.
                      Low overhead, ability to install on external drive (required for use on my laptop)

Issues encountered: none
Lessons learned: I hadn't used the import tool in pgAdmin 4 before. It works quite well for comma delimited files.
