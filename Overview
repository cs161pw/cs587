This project will use the Wisconsin Benchmark to test the performance of specific queries in PostgreSQL. 

Of particular interest are: comparison of aggregate queries with and without indices, selection of algorithms for join operations, 
and performance of update queries, with and without indices. 

There are three parts to the project: creation and population of the tables to be used in the testing, 
a discussion of why PostgreSQL was selected and of the tests to be run, and an analysis of the results of the benchmark testing.

> Part 1 - description of data file & table creation & population of tables
> Part 2 - discussion of rationale for selection of PostgreSQL, of tests to be run, and expected results
> Part 3 - analysis of testing
> queries.sql - scripts run to test
